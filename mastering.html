mastering

stereo only...every tweak affects all tracks

adding a db during eq of a master boosts it on ALL the tracks..so
- be careful of boosting on sum'd groups or master
- if you think you need +3db...only boost half and let your ears adjust...then ask if you really need that extra boost


Mastering is not about songs..it's also about album assembly

room accoustics can aggregate if someone is recording everything in the same space
