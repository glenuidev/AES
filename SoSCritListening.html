SoS critical listening session

waterfall graphs
- time / freq / db

100ms is a 1/10 second

quick fall-off vs long (thud vs boom)

boom is okay for hi-fi not for crit listening

Sealed cab speakers don't have the long resonance problem (not all)

Genelec 82/60 (resonates longer)

Big cabs can resonate without the right damping
some ported speakers are ok..probably get better as price goes up.

PMC speakers (advance transmission line)
- extended bass response for sealed speaker
- bass driver has consistent loading (low distortion, good bass at low listening level)

testing monitors...well recorded spoken voice
- human familiarity
- distortions or colorations can be picked up instinctively

well recorded references of human voice is key

BBC made their own speakers (relatively flat)

8in = full reference

45 degree off axis can totally affect the curves

Auditioning loudspeakers

come up with a short list
budget (defining limit)
the more you spend the better you get
intended use (near-field, midfield, etc.)
Features (subwoofer options,roomEQ)
- fashionable to have room eq, subs
Upgrade options and range consistency (smallers vs louders) stereo growing into 5.1 etc.
GOOD DEALER!! - if there is a prob you want support

Source Material
- Use good commercial tracks as well as your own material
- use your own material (intimately familiar)

Listen analytically and critically (informative != nice)

Ensure accurate level matching .2 .3 db can leave a diff impression (ping noise w level meter)

Louder = more exciting

Avoid A/B switching (only emphasises the differences...louder and brigter may not be telling you as much)
- short section 30 seconds...listen..what can you hear..tell about the instruments
- listen again...more? less?

Be careful of the tendency to favor louder and brighter

Some speakers like walls...some like open space...matters more in a small room

not all speakers are balance for on axis listening...know the toe angle that is intended

good to move about during listening..sit sound..move yada...phasey things can happen

"you look a bit of a prat but who cares"

listen for colouration / cross-over phasing etc.

good speakers you'll know quickly

looking at specs do rely completely on the drawing
- off axis is as important as on axis response
- a room gives on and off axis, what you ehar is the total sum...off axis response contributes to what you hear...a damp room removes this off axis color.
- compare the waterfall, impules, power cepstrum, source position


UK magazine (Resolution)
- good for accurate monitor graphs
- objective information

Environment
- is it masking low level distortions
- be aware of the situation you are in (speakers in walls corners)
- two pairs of speakers...pair A / B....image can be changed if you switch

A----B|A----B

vs

AB---------BA

Be careful about putting speakers too close together

Guide to small studios:

Basic room acoustics

-All untreated rooms have acoustic problems
-Degraded monitoring performance
-basic room treatment is easy to install
-improves room by at least 75%
-- mid range
-- stereo image

Environment
ideal listening rom has at least 30m2 volument to ensure evenly spread room modes and an even bass response (eg. 18x15)
the bigger the room the easier things get
room modes
- axial reflections top bottom left right
- Tangential
- Oblique

Loads of calculators online
EBU recommends an algebraic ratio
Acceptable room ratios
- after bolt beranek and newman

Physical Acoustics vs Virtual DSP processing
- improving room acoustics is usually cheap
far more effective than simple dsp
go mechanical
- mirror points / mirror treatment - can go too far
- install bass traps - can't overdo

Mirror points...where you can see your speaker from a mirror on the wall in seated position....you deen to dampen
spaced away from the wall will help
absorption on the back wall will help
"clouse on the ceiling"
dampen behind you
big enough room can capture room
absorber takes energy out of the room
difuser will put it (lively) back into the room

bass traps go in the corner
- foam based
- home made mineral wall traps
(wall wall wall ceiling)

Work down the long axis of the room, back wall reflections can be more reduced
Symmetry..moving the monitor position can help but in general keep it symetric

SPeakers to listening position...
equalateral tri...can be slightly inside the triangle

Factors
how big is the room
seating positions
too wide..falls apart...then bring it back..using spoken voice

Bass
- moving the speaker
- all styles of music
- balance not bloat
