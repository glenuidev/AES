Sound design

Crysis3 game design demo

mastered for internet = squashed to hell

Plugins

Trailers
- redone mappings for editing in a new session
  - music
  - events
  - timing / tempo maps (timestretches the main audio track to sync with effects)

sound effects using tempo maps
- set tracks to varispeed (pitch vs timing)
- draw pattern
- can be used on multiple tracks without modifying original audio


(low end = gravity)

5 frame leway of imperceptability

Waves plugins:

ultramaximizer
SSL
VST racks (check that out presets of vst stacks)
trans-dx multi (punch)
multitap 6
LoAir (low end cut)
HDelay (robotic sound)
C6 - Stereo
Mondo Mod
Z-noise
GTR stopp
Doppler Stereo
L2 Stereo
sound shifter (pitch)
Doubler

mastering

WLM Loudness Meter (broadcast mix to meter)



MASTER CHANNEL

MC DSP ML4000
effects dialog
master
- light compression
- heavy limiting
- 4band
then........
SurCode (dolby)
then....(l1 l2)
Sonnox oxford limiter (louder bigger)
then.
l2 to smooth out the edges
API (rather use multiband compressors)


game trailer mastering:
- mix to lowest denominator medium (stereo so it sounds better when expanded)
- mix for 5.1 (start in stereo) mix in stereo pan as if 5.1 (nice clean clear punchy in 5.1 if it sounds good in stereo)
- encoded stereo for internet etc.
(pl2 encoder helps emulate 5.1 in stereo)



MEDIUMS:
internet
tv
5.1


sounds and effects in games are "smaller" because you hear it a lot, but for a trailer it's likely to heavily enhanced and modified unless it's a "signature sound"






Waves: Analog :(
