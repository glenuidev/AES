Collaborative Mixing
--------------------

MNDR
peter wade (producer) amanda warner

have a standards methodology when you share...person to person..room to room

fabfilter
Waves / UAD (Sattelite)
Laptop rigs
optical out to converter

analog summing / internal 32bit through a converter (depending on song type)
- emi
- neve

"more digital - tough"
- mixing in the box is benefit

"the client"

Pre-mixing
- assumes delivered as a rough mix with stems
- balance (like a lot of backing vox)
- track count, simpler is better
- editing for vocals
- lots of duplication
- preserve the integrity of what the artist sent so you can communicate better (what they see / remember may not be what you see)


Plugins:
- Puigtec (2 bus)
- FF pro-q
- SSL bus mix
- Softtube TSAR1
- UAD 250 plate (140 and 224 is good)
- Doubler (detune 9 -9)

Improvising without having the "client" plugins
- mute them originally
- get screen shots if you need it
- try to match the rough mix...(mix setup)
- plosive and rough recording fixings
- cleaning the vocal up
- hi-pass, low cut

Fixing gain structure

Gaga recordings were on tour bus
- engine noise
- poor micing

Crazy turn arounds (fixed mastering date means be fast and use a lot of people!!!!)

Listen to "heavy metal lover" break before last chorus after build up...listen for kicks



Gain Staging:

Duplicate the aux that so you can seperate the summed tracks and treat them differently
